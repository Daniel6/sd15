Protein BLAST says that this long protein is in fact a Type 3 Secretion System Protein of Salmonella. This is a virulence factor in Salmonella that allows it to infect the host's cells. This finding would indicate that the sample that this protein sequence was taken from has Salmonella in it.

This protein could also be from an E. Coli. specimen, although the sequence coverage for the E. Coli. proteins would be less than that of Salmonella proteins.
