I downloaded static databases of item dictionaries for EvE Online and also made calls to EvE-Central web API to scrape market data collected from thousands of players. The static dictionaries were mainly to convert from system/item names to unique ids used by the API, and EvE-Central provided me with relatively up to date market information in commonly travelled regions. From this I hoped to make a tool to locate items that I could buy in one region and sell in another region for profit.
