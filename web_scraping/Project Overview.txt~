I downloaded static databases of item dictionaries for EvE Online and also made calls to EvE-Central web API to scrape market data collected from thousands of players. The static dictionaries were mainly to convert from system/item names to unique ids used by the API, and EvE-Central provided me with relatively up to date market information in commonly travelled regions.
